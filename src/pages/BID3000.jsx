-- The 3-month rolling average helps spot trends as: "Dotcom Postage" revenue is growing steadily

-- Business Interpretation:
-- 127 customers from different countries that generate £3.2M revenue (16% of total). 
-- They do have much higher cancellation rates though: 31% compared to the overall 1.84%. 
-- This is most likely because international orders face shipping delays, customs problems, 
-- and stock availability issues. For example, customer #14646 (the biggest international

-- spend around 3x more per order (£45 vs £14) and buy 8+ times per year. But still 42% of our
-- customers only buy once, which means we're missing out on £3.2M in potential loyalty from customers. 
-- We should treat different customer groups differently: VIP customers deserve 
-- premium service and exclusive offers, while medium-value customers need loyalty programs 
-- to encourage them to buy again. The business need customers to buy again.

-- of total) with very few cancellations. "Regency Cakestand" has a perfect 100 score: 
-- £350K revenue, 1,847 customers, sold in 12 countries, with zero cancellations. This 
-- product is perfect for marketing and expansion. On the other hand there are 23 "High Risk" 
-- products that have 15%+ cancellation rates. "Manual" is worst with 37.84% cancellations 
-- and £506K lost revenue. This needs to be looked at with a microscope and investigated properly.
-- Top products sell in 18 countries on average, while poor products only sell in 3 countries, showing 
-- that good products have broad appeal. This should be a no-brainer.
-- The health score helps us decide what to do: promote star products, fix high-risk products, 
-- and stop selling products with poor scores. Easy as that.
